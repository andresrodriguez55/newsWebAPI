### Description

With this project a start was made in the NOSQL databases and React. The page takes data from a free own firebase database.

For now, the database only has the option to read for all,
It is expected in the future to be able to make a management system that allows only admins to publish news from the page.

It has been totally focused on being able to make a responsible page and thus in the future to be able to start in React Native and to be able to transport this website to an application.
